At first the data of the neighbourhoods in Mumbai can be extracted out by web scraping using BeautifulSoup library for Python. The neighbourhood data is taken from a Wikipedia webpage mentioned above. The file contents from Mumbai csv is retrieved into a Pandas DataFrame. The latitude and longitude of the neighbourhoods are retrieved using geospacial data.The location values\nare then stored into the intial dataframe.From the location data obtained after the above data frame , the data is pointed out by passing in the required parameters to the FourSquare API, and creating another DataFrame to contain all the venue details along with the respective neighbourhoods. By choosing a methodology we obtain required locations"
